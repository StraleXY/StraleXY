### Hi everyone, I'm Strahinja SekuliÄ‡
I'm a student software developer who loves building cool stuff! Constantly tinkering with projects is my way of learning new technologies. I like tackling challenges bit by bit until they compose into the final feature while keeping the code clean and modular.
